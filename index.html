    <h1>Car Removal Checklist: What to Do Before We Tow Your Vehicle in Melbourne</h1>

    <p>Preparing to have a vehicle hauled away is a significant step in reclaiming your driveway and ensuring your old car is recycled responsibly. In a busy city like Melbourne, the process is straightforward, but it does require a bit of legwork from the owner to ensure everything stays above board. If you have booked a service through <strong>Melbourne Cash for Carz</strong>, following a structured plan will prevent last-minute stress and ensure the transaction is completed legally and safely.</p>

    <h2>1. Clear Out All Personal Belongings</h2>
    <p>Over the years, cars tend to collect a surprising amount of personal clutter. Before the tow truck arrives, do a final sweep of the entire cabin. Check the "hidden" spots like the map pockets behind the front seats, under the floor mats, and deep inside the center console. Don't forget to check the CD player for any favorite discs or the overhead sun visors for fuel receipts and gate passes.</p>

    <h2>2. Remove Your E-Tag and Toll Devices</h2>
    <p>For anyone driving around Melbourne, an E-Tag is a staple. These small transponders are often tucked behind the rearview mirror and are easily overlooked. Because these devices are linked directly to your bank account, leaving them in the car could result in you paying for the new owner's tolls. Carefully pry the device off the windshield and store it safely.</p>

    <h2>3. Handle the Number Plates and Registration</h2>
    <p>In Victoria, the registration plates are a critical part of the vehicle's identity. You should remove the plates before the car is loaded onto the tilt-tray. Taking these to a VicRoads service center allows you to formally cancel the registration and potentially receive a pro-rata refund on the remaining balance.</p>

    <h2>4. Prepare Your Identification and Documents</h2>
    <p>Even when a car is being sold for scrap, the law requires proper identification to prevent the unauthorized sale of vehicles. Have your current Victorian Driver’s License and any relevant paperwork, such as the registration certificate, ready to show the driver. Having these documents organized prevents delays and ensures the paperwork is finalized on the spot.</p>

    <h2>5. Ensure Easy Access for the Recovery Vehicle</h2>
    <p>Tow trucks require a fair amount of space to maneuver. If your car is parked in a tight driveway or behind other vehicles, try to move it to an accessible spot. Ensuring the <a href="https://www.melbournecashforcarz.com.au/" class="link-style">free car removal melbourne</a> team has a straight line to the vehicle will make the loading process much faster and safer.</p>

    <h2>6. Evaluate the Car's Current Value</h2>
    <p>It is often helpful to understand the logistics behind the offer you received. Many owners don't realize that <a href="https://melbournecashforcarz.codeberg.page/metalrecycling/" class="link-style">scrap metal prices</a> fluctuate based on global market demands, which directly impacts the final valuation of a junk vehicle. This knowledge ensures you are receiving a fair market rate for your specific make and model.</p>

    <h2>7. Cancel Your Insurance Policy</h2>
    <p>The moment the car is towed away, your liability should end. Once you have the receipt or confirmation of the transfer, call your insurance provider to cancel the policy. There is no point in paying for coverage on a vehicle that is no longer in your possession. Most insurers will stop the policy immediately and may refund the balance of your premium.</p>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Saying goodbye to an old vehicle doesn't have to be a complicated ordeal. By taking the time to remove your personal items, securing your number plates, and ensuring the paperwork is in order, you turn a potential headache into a smooth, professional transaction. Following this checklist ensures that once the tow truck pulls away, you are left with nothing but extra space and the peace of mind that the job was done right.</p>
